        <h2>What is Blackjack?</h2>
        <p>
            Blackjack is a card game where players aim to get a hand that is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand, 
            without going over 21. Each card is worth its face value, with face cards (Jack, Queen, King) worth 10 and Aces worth either 1 or 11. 
            The game is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards.

        <h2> Rules of Blackjack</h2>
        <p>The goal of blackjack is simple.
             All one needs to do to win is have a higher hand value than the dealer, without going over 21. 
             Players are dealt two cards and can then choose to “hit” (receive additional cards) or “stand” (keep their current hand). 
             The dealer also receives two cards, but only one is face up.
             If a player’s hand exceeds 21, they “bust” and lose the game. 
             If the dealer busts, all remaining players win. If neither the player nor the dealer busts, 
             the player with the highest hand value wins.
