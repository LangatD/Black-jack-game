        <h3>Double Down</h3>
        <p>
            This is an option open to the player for doubling their bet when the original two cards dealt total 9, 10, or 11. 
            When the player's turn comes, they place a bet equal to the original bet, and the dealer gives the player just 
            one card, which is placed face down and is not turned up until the bets are settled at the end of the hand.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Surrender</h3>
        <p>
            If you have an especially bad hand, you can "surrender" to the dealer instead of hitting or staying. Surrendering 
            deducts 50% off your original bet, but it can save you from a total loss. To signal a surrender to the dealer, 
            slide your pointer finger in a horizontal line on the game table. Note that not all casinos may allow surrendering.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Insurance</h3>
        <p>
            When the dealer's face-up card is an ace, any of the players may make a side bet of up to half the original bet 
            that the dealer's face-down card is a ten-card, and thus a blackjack for the house. Once all such side bets are 
            placed, the dealer looks at the hole card. If it is a ten-card, it is turned up, and those players who have made 
            the insurance bet win and are paid double the amount of their half-bet – a 2 to 1 payoff. When a blackjack occurs 
            for the dealer, the hand is over, and the players' main bets are collected – unless a player also has blackjack, 
            in which case it is a stand-off. Insurance is generally not a good proposition for the player unless they are 
            confident that there are an unusually high number of ten-cards still left undealt.
